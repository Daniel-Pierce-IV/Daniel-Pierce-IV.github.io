			<p>I'm Daniel, an autodidact freelance developer living in the greater Seattle area, specifically in Bellevue, WA. I've been toying with code on-and-off for about four years, taking a serious approach to building my skill within the last two. I find programming to be a challenging and fun experience, and I'd love to turn this hobby into a rewarding career.</p>

			<p>I'm fresh to the world of professional development, but I'm confident that my commitment to learning, constant effort to grow as a developer and my personal dogma of never giving anything less than my best effort will make me an asset to any team.</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of time learning about interesting web development topics, but occasionally a man has to appreciate the other fine things in life. When I'm not neck-deep in code or study material, I enjoy being an avid gamer, taking my wife out for a night on the town, and climbing the occasional rock wall or two. </p>

			<p>I always interested in new opportunities to put my skills to use. If you have a position to fill, or a job that needs  taken care of, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:Admin@Daniel-Pierce-IV.com">shoot me an email.</a></p>

			<p>Until then, I'll be coding.</p>
